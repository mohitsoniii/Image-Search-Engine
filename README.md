# Image Search Application
This project is a dynamic image search web application that leverages the Unsplash API to provide users with a seamless way to search and browse high-quality images.
## Features:
* **Search Functionality**: Users can search for images based on keywords.
* **Pagination**: Load additional results with a "Show More" button for a continuous browsing experience.
* **Image Preview and Linking**: Each image links to its original source on Unsplash for further exploration.
* **Responsive Design**: Optimized for different screen sizes.
## Technologies Used:
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **API Integration**: Unsplash API
- **Asynchronous Programming**: fetch API with async/await
## Future Enhancements:
1. Add loading indicators for better user experience.
2. Implement error handling for API failures.
3. Integrate filters (e.g., orientation, color, etc.) for refined search results.
4. Improve UI/UX with CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind.
